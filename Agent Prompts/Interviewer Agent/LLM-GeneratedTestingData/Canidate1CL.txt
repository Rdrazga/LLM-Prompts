**Hiring Manager**
BrightWave Analytics
Remote – Denver, CO

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Data Engineer position at BrightWave Analytics. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science, over twelve years of hands‑on data engineering experience, and a proven track record leading cloud‑native analytics initiatives at GlobalInsights Inc. and FinEdge Technologies, I am confident in my ability to design, build, and maintain the scalable data platforms that power BrightWave’s real‑time analytics and AI offerings.

At GlobalInsights Inc., I managed a team of fifteen data professionals to architect a multi‑tenant data lake on AWS S3—leveraging Lake Formation to reduce data onboarding time by 60%. I also led the development of a Spark‑based feature engineering pipeline for real‑time fraud detection, boosting model accuracy by 18%. By instituting Terraform and CloudFormation modules alongside a CI/CD workflow for Airflow DAGs, I ensured zero‑downtime deployments and repeatable infrastructure across environments.

Prior to that, at FinEdge Technologies, I built Kafka‑powered streaming ingestion pipelines ingesting over one billion events daily and migrated an on‑premises Oracle warehouse to Redshift—cutting storage costs by 45% and query latencies by 35%. I championed data quality automation with Great Expectations, catching issues before they impacted downstream analytics. In each role, I’ve paired deep technical expertise with a passion for mentorship: I regularly lead “Data Hackathons,” mentor junior engineers, and deliver technical talks at conferences such as AWS re\:Invent.

BrightWave’s mission to deliver actionable insights through advanced analytics resonates deeply with me. I am excited by the opportunity to collaborate with your data scientists and engineers to extend your AWS‑based platforms, implement robust data governance, and accelerate pipeline performance. My experience with Airflow, Kafka, Glue, Redshift, and infrastructure‑as‑code tools, coupled with my leadership in on‑call support and incident remediation, aligns directly with the responsibilities outlined in your posting.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background and vision for scalable, high‑quality data systems can contribute to BrightWave Analytics’s continued growth. Please find my resume attached, and I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,

Dr. Alexandra “Alex” Ramirez, Ph.D.
