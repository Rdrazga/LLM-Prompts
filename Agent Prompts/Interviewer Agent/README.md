**Work In Progress prompts for an automated hiring system, Readme and prompts will be updated over time.**

Theoretical use case: Reviewing canidate provided info (Resume, Cover letter, LinkedIn page, and context from the interview agent/projects)

Running a short screening interview with the canidate (Thinking text-based, seeing bad responses on LinkedIn on canidates disliking voice/video calls, and lets canidates upload projects if they want.)

Creating a semi-quantitative score for the job

Issues to think about while building:
- Dynamic system that can adapt to different job requirements?
- Abuseability/bypassing it with smart prompting
- Checking for AI generated content in interview process (Ironic, However in the future canidates who spend the time to make their own content or at least edit AI responses might be better prospect showing a willingness to put effort in.)
- How in depth does the "interview" process go? And can it be a process that can be done as few times as possible so canidates don't get annoyed with it?
- What deliverable would be best for recruiters
- What flow is the least intrusive for canidates

Added mock canidates and a job listing for testing, created by GPT o4-mini. Proper testing should include a couple aspects:
- Real job listing with recruiter giving low additional explanation
- Real job listing with recruiter giving medium explanation and testing
- Real job listing with recruiter tailoring their listing and giving extra information to maximize use of this system
- Real canidate applications, cover letteres, and projects
