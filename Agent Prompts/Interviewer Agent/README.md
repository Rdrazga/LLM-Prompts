Work In Progress prompts for an automated hiring system.

Theoretical use case: Reviewing canidate provided info (Resume, Cover letter, LinkedIn page, and context from the interview agent/projects)

Running a short screening interview with the canidate (Thinking text-based, seeing bad responses on LinkedIn on canidates disliking voice/video calls, and lets canidates upload projects if they want.)

Creating a semi-quantitative score for the job

Issues to think about while building:
- Dynamic system that can adapt to different job requirements?
- Abuseability/bypassing it with smart prompting
- Checking for AI generated content in interview process
- How in depth does the "interview" process go? And can it be a process that can be done as few times as possible so canidates don't get annoyed with it?
- What deliverable would be best for recruiters
- What flow is the least intrusive for canidates
