{task}

Create and use a plan.md file to plan out each type, system, or function. On the first pass write out key considerations the system needs to work, on the second and following passes write out considerations on each of those sytems, how it needs to interract with other systems, the logic it needs to follow, and math it needs to adhere to. Only write a single system per repsonse.

Iteratively review the plan by re-reading the file, consider potential issues or improvements, and add them to the plan.

On the third pass once all systems are written, read through the plan file again, confirm the systems all integrate with each other properly, and consider possible issues. Re-write the file as needed to address these and keep doing this until confident the plan fully defines the solution to the problem in a no-code way.

Always expect that systems are more complex then you might expect, so you need to write down and plan in a way that clearly explains the logic you need to use to solve those complexities.
